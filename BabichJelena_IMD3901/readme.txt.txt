Put bluntly, there was no earthly possible way I was going to be able to complete this assignment,
given that no matter how hard I try I cannot wrap my brain around the most basic concepts of it. Hence I also
failed to complete A2 previously. However, I did at least make the attempt (and am making use of the Forgiveness
clause) and this is the best I could possibly do.

I decided to make the simplest thing I could think of that was both collaborative and competitive: block stacking.
As young children will try to stack a tower of toy blocks as high as possible, and probably knock over another kid's
tower, it seemed like the easiest thing I could possibly make for this assignment within my limitations of not knowing
what I'm doing. I started out very simply with the environment, building the room that the game would be contained in,
and putting a single test block in front of the user. Even this much took me several hours of trying to force my brain
to comprehend the documentation provided to me, not helped by the fact that many of the documents just load for eternity
on my computer when I try to test them.

Next, I needed to outline interactions. I wrote out the to-do list in comments, then consulted my classmates for help. I 
was recommended to "spawn" objects by hiding duplicates as child objects to the parented original, and have the original be
manipulable by making it a child to the user. It took me 20 minutes to even figure out how to hide an object in the first place.
After making a handful of child duplicates, each a different color, I needed to figure out how to move an object parent. After futzing
around with the controls for another 20 minutes to make the thing usable on a VR headset, I realized the documentation I was looking at
recommended a better way to spawn objects that was actually infinite. I went on to implement that. Or so I thought it was better: I
struggled very much to get it to work. This was about as far as I got before 11:30pm at which point I did the best debugging I could,
and any further development wasn't possible.
